source:
  # This is the plugin provided by this module.
  plugin: gathercontent

  # The plugin requires either a project_id OR project_name + account_stub.
  project_id: 98765
  # If you do not know your project_id, you may use project_name and
  # account_stub instead. The account stub is the subdomain used in your
  # GatherContent URL when you log in, e.g. https://mycompany.gathercontent.com
  # project_name: My GatherContent Project
  # account_stub: mycompany

  # Optional. Providing a template_name will filter the migration to items using
  # only this template. It will also allow you to get more complete information
  # about the available source fields when you use the
  # `drush migrate-fields-source` command (provided by the migrate_tools
  # module).
  template_name: Profile
  # As an alternative, you may also provide your template_id directly.
  # template_id: 1234

  # Filters allow you to include and exclude GatherContent items based on
  # specific properties. You may match on a single value, or on a set of values.
